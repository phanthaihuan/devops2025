#### Information Security and Ethical Hacking Overview
1. PCI DSS: PCI stood for “Payment Card Industry” and DSS stood for “Data Security Standard,” this one was a piece of cake. PCI DSS is actually an evaluation standard developed by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (PCI SSC, which includes American Express, Discover, MasterCard, and Visa, by the way) to secure networks and storage environments for credit card consumer data.
2. TCSEC: The Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC) security evaluation standard is also known as the Orange Book and was created by the DoD to define different types of access controls.
3. TNIEG: The Trusted Network Interpretation Environments Guideline (TNIEG) outlines minimum security protections required in networking environments.
   
#### Reconnaissance Techniques
1. Shoulder surfing
#### System Hacking Phases and Attack Techniques

#### Web Application Hacking
1. Fuzzing: an automated testing method where tons of randomly generated entries are jammed into the application to see what happens.
2. CSPP: A connection string parameter pollution (CSPP) attack takes advantage of web applications that communicate with databases by using semicolons to separate parameters. An attacker can end a parameter prematurely with a semicolon and then add his own code.

#### Network and Perimeter Hacking
1. False-positive generation
2. Session splicing
3. Source routing
4. Address spoofing

#### Mobile Platform, IoT, and OT Hacking
1. Semi-tethered jailbreaking
2. Bluesniffing: is an effort to sniff data from Bluetooth exchanges.
3. Bluesmacking: is a Dos attack.
4. Bluescarfing: is the actual theft of data from a Bluetooth device.
5. Bluejacking: ia s Bluetooth attack where the attacker sends unsolicited messages to the target.
6. 
#### Cloud Computing
1. Cloud consumer: is the individual or organization that acquires and uses cloud products and services.
2. Cloud carrier: is the organization that has the responsibility of transferring the data, akin to the power distributor for the electric grid.
3. Cloud auditor: is the independent assessor of cloud service and security controls.
4. Cloud broker: acts to manage the use, performance, and delivery of cloud services as well as the relationships between providers and subscribers.
5. CloudPassage Halo: provides instant visibility and continuous protection for servers in any combination of data centers, private clouds, and public clouds.
